<h4>What does the program do?</h4>

In my experience I had to set up my Wifi Pineapple many times, sometimes due to the need to install it on different devices,
others because the network parameters were mysteriously forgotten by Windows, and it also happened to me simply by 
disconnecting the Wifi Pineapple from the USB port.
Every time you have to enter the IPv4 network parameters and reset the correct address,  and in the long run it can become frustrating ...

Hence the need to write a simple program that did these simple maneuvers automatically.

The program is written in DOS for backward compatibility with Windows systems.

<h4>Requirements</h4>

The Network MUST be named "WIFI_PINEAPPLE" (u can use the function "3" of this utility)
